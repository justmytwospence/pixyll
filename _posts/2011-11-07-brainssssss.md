About a month ago the topic of [SPLASH](http://stanfordesp.org) came up in one
of our weekly lab meetings. Its a great (if somewhat sneaky) way for us to
recruit new control subjects because the students are the perfect age for our
pediatric studies. We just have to get the kids psyched enough to pester their
parents to the point that they contact us. Our lab has taught classes in
previous years on rummaging, etc. and gotten a few recruits out of it.

A coworker and I were brainstorming class ideas when we hit upon a sure winner-
“Brainssssss: The Neuroscience of Zombies.”  SPLASH took place over Halloween
weekend this year after all, and we thought it would be the perfect way to walk
the fine line between being fun and interesting enough to keep kids excited and
being academically legitimate enough to take seriously.

The class was way fun to plan and even more fun to teach. I managed to get in
touch with the neuroanatomy TA in the medical school, who hooked us up with some
preserved human brains- one full brain, one hemisphere, one set of coronal
slices, a segment of spinal cord, and some dura matter too. It was surprising
how easily we procured them!  No background check or signing of papers, just a
few emails and an explanation of how to keep them moist and always use gloves
before we were sent on our way with two buckets full of brains (very subtly
labelled “Whole Brain”). We got them a week early, so they were a huge hit with
everyone in our lab. It was interesting how many people who study the brain for
a living have never seen one in the flesh (as it were). The first thing anyone
seeing a brain for the first time notices is how *small* they are. But that mere
3 pounds of meat can learn calculus, predict the future, or even fall in
love. Crazy.

Some more emails got me in touch with a guy named Brad Voytek who does research
up the peninsula at UCSF. Brad is on the advisory board of the Zombie Research
Society and it would appear that we accidentally stumbled upon a phenomenon that
is already gaining momentum- the field of zombie research! Check out the
[Zombie Research Society][] as well as his personal bog
[Oscillatory Thoughts][].  The ZRS is simultaneously a fun way to introduce
basic neuroscience to a public audience (just as we had thought!), while also
poking fun at some of the more questionable aspects of cognitive neuroscience
research (eg: look doing X lights up area Y… now we understand X!). Much
gratitude for all their assistance!

The class itself went great. We had kids brainstorm characteristics of zombies
(slow lumbering walk, lack of emotions, insatiable appetite for human flesh,
etc.) and then delved into which brain regions would be impaired in order for us
to see these specific defecits in behavior. And of course we played Thriller and
showed multiple clips from Shaun of the Dead. I think the kids really liked it,
and of course you can’t go wrong when you get to show them real brains.

We signed up for 4 sections of 30 students each, which apparently was way more
than the average class size of 5 to 10 students. A scheduling mishap left us
with only 3 sections, so we set up in an empty room during the lunch period and
I went outside and rounded up another class-worth of kids to make up the
difference. Additionally, we were contacted by an administrator to teach our
class to some of the parents as a sample SPLASH class. The parents class kind of
turned into a Q & A session of general neuroscience questions, which was
actually really fun. We got some real great questions from kids too: “can
zombies get high?” , “would tranquilizers work on zombies?” , and from a
tentative girl at the end of class “wait… zombies are real?”

Overall it was a great success, we got out a lot of fliers, and lots of
kids/parents sounded very interested in our research at Stanford. I’m hoping to
get more involved with SPLASH at Stanford next semester!
