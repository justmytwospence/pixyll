<article class="post-content">
  <p><img src="http://spencerboucher.com/images/stanford.gif" alt="Stanford University"></p>

<p>About a month ago the topic of <a href="http://stanfordesp.org">SPLASH</a> came
up in one of our weekly lab meetings. Its a great (if somewhat sneaky)
way for us to recruit new control subjects because the students are
the perfect age for our pediatric studies. We just have to get the
kids psyched enough to pester their parents to the point that they
contact us. Our lab has taught classes in previous years on rummaging,
etc. and gotten a few recruits out of it.</p>

<p>A coworker and I were brainstorming class ideas when we hit upon a
sure winner- “Brainssssss: The Neuroscience of Zombies.”  SPLASH took
place over Halloween weekend this year after all, and we thought it
would be the perfect way to walk the fine line between being fun and
interesting enough to keep kids excited and being academically
legitimate enough to take seriously.</p>

<p>The class was way fun to plan and even more fun to teach. I managed to
get in touch with the neuroanatomy TA in the medical school, who
hooked us up with some preserved human brains- one full brain, one
hemisphere, one set of coronal slices, a segment of spinal cord, and
some dura matter too. It was surprising how easily we procured them!
No background check or signing of papers, just a few emails and an
explanation of how to keep them moist and always use gloves before we
were sent on our way with two buckets full of brains (very subtly
labelled “Whole Brain”). We got them a week early, so they were a huge
hit with everyone in our lab. It was interesting how many people who
study the brain for a living have never seen one in the flesh (as it
were). The first thing anyone seeing a brain for the first time
notices is how <em>small</em> they are. But that mere 3 pounds of meat can
learn calculus, predict the future, or even fall in love. Crazy.</p>

<p>Some more emails got me in touch with a guy named Brad Voytek who does
research up the peninsula at UCSF. Brad is on the advisory board of
the Zombie Research Society and it would appear that we accidentally
stumbled upon a phenomenon that is already gaining momentum- the field
of zombie research! Check out the
<a href="zombieresearch.org">Zombie Research Society</a> as well as his personal
bog <a href="blog.ketyov.com">Oscillatory Thoughts</a>.  The ZRS is
simultaneously a fun way to introduce basic neuroscience to a public
audience (just as we had thought!), while also poking fun at some of
the more questionable aspects of cognitive neuroscience research (eg:
look doing X lights up area Y… now we understand X!). Much gratitude
for all their assistance!</p>

<p><img src="http://spencerboucher.com/images/axial.jpg" alt="A &quot;zombie&quot; brain!"></p>

<p>The class itself went great. We had kids brainstorm characteristics of
zombies (slow lumbering walk, lack of emotions, insatiable appetite
for human flesh, etc.) and then delved into which brain regions would
be impaired in order for us to see these specific defecits in
behavior. And of course we played Thriller and showed multiple clips
from Shaun of the Dead. I think the kids really liked it, and of
course you can’t go wrong when you get to show them real brains.</p>

<p>We signed up for 4 sections of 30 students each, which apparently was
way more than the average class size of 5 to 10 students. A scheduling
mishap left us with only 3 sections, so we set up in an empty room
during the lunch period and I went outside and rounded up another
class-worth of kids to make up the difference. Additionally, we were
contacted by an administrator to teach our class to some of the
parents as a sample SPLASH class. The parents class kind of turned
into a Q &amp; A session of general neuroscience questions, which was
actually really fun. We got some real great questions from kids too:
“can zombies get high?” , “would tranquilizers work on zombies?” , and
from a tentative girl at the end of class “wait… zombies are real?”</p>

<p>Overall it was a great success, we got out a lot of fliers, and lots
of kids/parents sounded very interested in our research at
Stanford. I’m hoping to get more involved with SPLASH at Stanford next
semester!</p>
