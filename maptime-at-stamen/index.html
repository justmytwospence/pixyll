  <p>fooo</p>

<p>Last week, a classmate and I took a break from coursework to attend
one of the many great Meetup events that San Francisco has to offer
for data science practitioners. I’ve been pushing myself to attend at
least one data-centric Meetup every week, because these events are one
of the most amazing parts about going to school in the same place
where so many of the biggest names work. To be honest, I believe that
becoming a presence in the data science scene and meeting the movers
and shakers is equally if not more important than coursework.</p>

<p>I actually attended 3 meetups last week, one about D3.js at Trulia HQ,
one about GIS technologies and the Code for America HQ, and one about
mapping at Stamen HQ. I picked all three because they are relevant to
a geospatial data visualization that I am working on for my practicum
at AutoGrid, but the last one is what I’m going to talk a bit about,
because it was the most hands-on.</p>

<p>The workshop took place at Stamen Design’s headquarters in the Mission
and was led by Eric Theise; you can see his beautiful/informative
slides (created using <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js">reveal.js</a>)
<a href="http://erictheise.github.io/geostack-deck">here</a>. Some useful Q&amp;A
happened on
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-SF/events/147110652">the Meetup event page as well</a>.</p>

<p>This was actually a two-part workshop, but it was relatively painless
to follow the instructions and get up to speed for the part II, so you
should really give it a shot even now if it looks interesting.</p>

<p>First we got postgres up and running on our machines. I have local
installations of MySQL, MongoDB, Hadoop and Hive up and running thanks
to our course in Distributed Databases, but our class didn’t have time
to get to postgres within a single credit hour. This, despite the fact
that our professor admits to postgres being the best database to use
if you have anything to say about it.</p>

<p>Next, we populated our database with some data from
OpenStreetMap. Mike Migurski extracts data from OSM for major
metropolitan areas on a semi-regular basis, so we used the San
Francisco data [available on his web site][] via
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql">osm2pgsql</a>, a
command-line utility that loads OpenStreetMap data into PostgreSQL
databases.</p>

<p>Then we used <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill">TileMill</a>, MapBox’s
desktop application, to visualize our newborn database. We discovered
how remarkably easy it can be to create vector layers for data
contained in such a postGIS database using the same old SQL and CSS
syntax you already know and love. Eric introduced us to some sensible
pre-baked
<a href="https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto">CartoCSS boilerplate</a>
courtesy of Andy Allen.</p>

<p>Lastly, we used a nifty feature of TileMill to actually bake our own
map tiles and serve them up for use in our own maps. Note that if you
want to do this, you’ll need the
<a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mbutil">mbutil command-line utility</a>, not
currently mentioned in the slide deck.</p>

<p>Not too shabby for 2 hours on a Wednesday night. Many thanks to the
guys at Stamen for hosting, especially Eric for all his work on the
slides. Not to mention the many other brilliant people who have made
the tools and resources that allow something this involved and
grandiose to be done on a laptop by someone who is still learning the
ropes. Hands-on workshops like this are one of the best ways to learn
these technologies. Case in point, I may not have ever stumbled across
Mike or Andy’s resources had I not been learning directly from people
who are intimately familiar with the practical ins and outs of digital
cartography.</p>

<p>Digital mapping is rapidly capturing my interest because of the
beautifully functional things one can do with it, and it seems like an
amazing time to be learning it, because the ecosystem is beginning to
really flourish. Looking forward to more events!</p>
